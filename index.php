            I've traveled over four-thousand miles to get to where I am. Born and raised in Miami, Florida, in 2008, I undertook a two-month car journey to Seattle, Washington, taking in the various sights and sites along the way. To this day, it remains my greatest adventure.

            Now, I'm on a different sort of journey, one of self-improvement as I pursue a degree in the field of web development. I have an interest in working with non-profit organizations, which is what I ultimately hope to do with my degree and the skills I develop while working toward it. In the 21st century, it is important for organizations of all sorts to have a viable web presence; this is not limited only to for-profit businesses; non-profits need to have it as well in order to spread awareness of their cause, maximize reach, and obtain the donations they need to continue their good and important work.
